            <h2>Amber's Experiments</h2>
            <p>Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. We have a fantastic little sky! Anything you want to do you can do here. Little short strokes.</p>

            <p>It's cold, but it's beautiful. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out.</p>

            <p>With practice comes confidence. Everybody needs a friend. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license.</p>

            <p>I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. Zip. That easy. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart.</p>

            <p>I'm a water fanatic. I love water. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. Let's build some happy little clouds up here.</p>
